Scenarios for Test Application :
1) when the arrival and departure stations are same the fare computed should be zero
2) the fare for station A to station B and station B to station A should be the same
3) multiple bookings should be allowed on the same date
4) multiple bookings from the same departure station should be allowed
5) multiple bookings to the same arrival station should be allowed
6) multiple bookings for the same booking class should be allowed
7) different booking classes for the same set of stations should be allowed
8) the PNR should serially increase for each booking
9) each booking must be added to the booking vector
10) the fare should be computed correctly according to the logic given.
11) the fare between two stations should be independent of the date
